Description: Multi-stage cluster surveys of households are commonly performed by
  governments and programmes to monitor population-level demographic, social,
  economic, and health outcomes. Generally, communities are sampled from
  subpopulations (strata) in a first stage, and then households are listed and
  sampled in a second stage. In this typical two-stage design, sampled
  communities are the Primary Sampling Units (PSUs) and households are the
  Secondary Sampling Units (SSUs). Census data typically serve as the sample
  frame from which PSUs are selected. However, if census data are outdated
  inaccurate, or too geographically coarse, gridded population data (such as
  <http://www.worldpop.org.uk>) can be used as a sample frame instead.
  GridSample (<doi:10.1186/s12942-017-0098-4>) generates PSUs from
  gridded population data according to user-specified complex survey design
  characteristics and household sample size. In gridded population sampling,
  like census sampling, PSUs are selected within each stratum using a
  serpentine sampling method, and can be oversampled in urban or rural areas to
  ensure a minimum sample size in each of these important sub-domains.
  Furthermore, because grid cells are uniform in size and shape, gridded
  population sampling allows for samples to be representative of both the
  population and of space, which is not possible with a census sample frame.
